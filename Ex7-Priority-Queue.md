# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:03/03/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting
6. End of the program.  

## Program:
```

*/
```
```
/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;
  //type your code here...
  for(i=0;i<size;i++)
  {
      printf("%d ",array[i]);
  }
}
```
